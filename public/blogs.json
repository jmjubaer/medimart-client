Factors that influence the choice include:</p><ul><li>Age</li><li>Ethnicity</li><li>Overall health</li><li>Other medical conditions</li><li>Potential side effects</li><li>Cost and insurance coverage</li></ul><h2>Managing Side Effects</h2><p>All medications can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.

Often, adjusting the dosage or switching to a different medication can help.</p><h2>Tips for Taking Blood Pressure Medications</h2><ul><li>Take medications at the same time each day</li><li>Use pill organizers or smartphone reminders</li><li>Don't skip doses</li><li>Continue taking medications even if your blood pressure improves</li><li>Keep regular appointments with your healthcare provider</li></ul><p>Remember, medication is just one part of blood pressure management.

Types include:</p><ul><li><strong>Rapid-acting:</strong> Begins working within 15 minutes, peaks in 1-2 hours</li><li><strong>Short-acting:</strong> Begins working within 30 minutes, peaks in 2-3 hours</li><li><strong>Intermediate-acting:</strong> Begins working within 2-4 hours, peaks in 4-12 hours</li><li><strong>Long-acting:</strong> Works for 24+ hours with no peak</li></ul><p>Insulin can be administered via injections, pens, or pumps.</p><h3>Oral Medications for Type 2 Diabetes</h3><h4>Metformin</h4><p>Usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works by:</p><ul><li>Reducing glucose production in the liver</li><li>Improving insulin sensitivity</li><li>Decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose</li></ul><h4>Sulfonylureas</h4><p>These medications stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. Examples include glipizide and glimepiride.</p><h4>DPP-4 Inhibitors</h4><p>These help the body continue to make insulin when blood sugar is high. Examples include sitagliptin and linagliptin.</p><h4>SGLT2 Inhibitors</h4><p>These cause the kidneys to remove glucose from the body through urine. Examples include empagliflozin and dapagliflozin.</p><h4>Thiazolidinediones</h4><p>These improve insulin sensitivity. Examples include pioglitazone and rosiglitazone.</p><h3>Injectable Medications (Non-Insulin)</h3><h4>GLP-1 Receptor Agonists</h4><p>These slow digestion and help lower blood glucose levels. Examples include semaglutide and dulaglutide.</p><h4>Amylin Analogues</h4><p>These slow stomach emptying and reduce after-meal blood sugar spikes. The main example is pramlintide.</p><h2>Combination Medications</h2><p>Some medications combine two different diabetes drugs in one pill, which can make it easier to take multiple medications.</p><h2>Factors in Medication Selection</h2><p>Your healthcare provider will consider several factors when recommending diabetes medications:</p><ul><li>Type of diabetes</li><li>Blood glucose levels</li><li>Other health conditions</li><li>Potential side effects</li><li>Cost and insurance coverage</li><li>Convenience and lifestyle</li></ul><h2>Managing Side Effects</h2><p>Common side effects vary by medication type but may include:</p><ul><li>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</li><li>Gastrointestinal issues</li><li>Weight changes</li><li>Urinary tract infections</li></ul><p>Always discuss any side effects with your healthcare provider rather than stopping medication on your own.</p><h2>Monitoring Effectiveness</h2><p>Regular blood glucose monitoring and A1C tests help determine if your medication is working effectively. Your treatment plan may need adjustments over time as your body changes.</p><p>Remember, diabetes medications work best when combined with healthy eating, regular physical activity, and other lifestyle measures. Work closely with your healthcare team to develop a comprehensive diabetes management plan.</p>",

They work by:</p><ul><li>Blocking a substance your liver needs to make cholesterol</li><li>Helping your liver remove cholesterol from your blood</li><li>Reducing inflammation in the artery walls</li></ul><p>Examples include atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin.</p><h3>Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors</h3><p>These medications reduce the absorption of cholesterol from your diet.

Examples include alirocumab and evolocumab.</p><h3>Bile Acid Sequestrants</h3><p>These medications bind to bile acids in the intestines, which leads to lower cholesterol levels. Examples include cholestyramine and colesevelam.</p><h3>Fibrates</h3><p>Fibrates primarily lower triglycerides and may slightly increase HDL (good) cholesterol. Examples include fenofibrate and gemfibrozil.</p><h3>Niacin (Nicotinic Acid)</h3><p>Niacin can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while raising HDL cholesterol.
